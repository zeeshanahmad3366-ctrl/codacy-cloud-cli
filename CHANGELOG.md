# @codacy/codacy-cloud-cli

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/35) [`72a4d3b`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/72a4d3b2f3a7572108f8b297b49ef8ba76c48718) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - New `pull-requests` (`prs`) command: lists pull requests for a repository, with the same analysis-gated columns as `repository`'s "Open Pull Requests" table. `-q, --search` and `-B, --base` filter by free text (title/author handle) and target branch, mapping to the API's `textQuery`/`targetBranch` params; `-S, --state` filters by open (default) or closed.

### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/35) [`72a4d3b`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/72a4d3b2f3a7572108f8b297b49ef8ba76c48718) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - Fix `findings`'s pagination warning silently not firing when the API response omits `pagination.total`: the guard now also checks for a remaining `cursor`, so a trailing page of results is no longer hidden from the `--limit` hint.

- [#35](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/35) [`72a4d3b`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/72a4d3b2f3a7572108f8b297b49ef8ba76c48718) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - `formatStandards()` (used by `repository`'s Open Pull Requests table, `pull-request`'s Up to Standards row, and `pull-requests`' ✓ column) now shows a dim `⋯` while a pull request is still being analysed, instead of falling through to a hard ✗ on gate data that isn't final yet.

- [#35](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/35) [`72a4d3b`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/72a4d3b2f3a7572108f8b297b49ef8ba76c48718) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - Fix PR complexity showing as no data, and polish the `pull-requests` table. Complexity is now read from the API's nested `quality` object, which is where the pull-request endpoints actually return it — `pull-requests`, `pull-request` and `repository` all previously rendered it as empty. The `pull-requests` table now leads with the up-to-standards column, orders metrics the same way `repositories` does (issues, complexity, duplication, coverage), hides the Coverage column when no listed PR has coverage data, shows `-` instead of `N/A` for metrics with no value, and no longer signs a zero issue count (`0` instead of `-0`). `--output json` now includes the quality and coverage `resultReasons`, so consumers can see which gates passed or failed.

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#34](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/34) [`c26ff79`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/c26ff795df60e9cc8b54a7ab782fa80bffb12e62) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - `issue`, `issues`, `pull-request --issue`, `finding`, and `findings` now show vulnerable/affected functions for SCA issues and findings with a linked OSV advisory (`CommitIssue.advisoryInformation` / `SrmItem.advisoryInformation`). Card views show a compact one-line summary; detail views show the full list with advisory ID and published date. Included in `--output json` for all five commands.

### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/30) [`12c1a33`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/12c1a332f41163298344e794bf6ce2dee4a95366) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Neutralize terminal control characters in human-readable output (CWE-150).
  Repository-derived values shown by the CLI — PR and finding titles, author
  names, branches, file paths, diff and file content, issue messages, and package
  names — are now stripped of ANSI/OSC escape and other control bytes before being
  printed, so a crafted pull request can no longer repaint or hide findings, spoof
  gate status, or trigger terminal side effects (e.g. clipboard writes) when you
  run the CLI against it. Offending bytes are shown in visible caret notation
  (e.g. `^[`) instead of being interpreted. `--output json` is unaffected — it
  still returns the original values, escaped by JSON encoding.

- [#34](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/34) [`c26ff79`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/c26ff795df60e9cc8b54a7ab782fa80bffb12e62) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - Sanitize vulnerable/affected function names and the advisory ID (`CommitIssue.advisoryInformation` / `SrmItem.advisoryInformation`) before printing them in `issue`, `issues`, `pull-request --issue`, `finding`, and `findings`. These values come from the linked OSV advisory, so — like other repository-derived output — they are now passed through `sanitizeText()` to strip ANSI/OSC control bytes (CWE-150) instead of being printed raw.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#28](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/28) [`440a57f`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/440a57fec915aae6fcebf9cc8dde6fca9d71c266) Thanks [@claudiacodacy](https://github.com/claudiacodacy)! - `codacy issues --ignore` now asks for confirmation before bulk-ignoring. It
  prints how many issues match the current filters and only proceeds when you
  answer `y`, guarding against a mistyped or too-broad filter ignoring far more
  issues than intended. Pass `--skip-confirmation` (`-y`) to bypass the prompt in
  CI or scripts; in a non-interactive shell without that flag the command aborts
  without ignoring anything.

- [#28](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/28) [`440a57f`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/440a57fec915aae6fcebf9cc8dde6fca9d71c266) Thanks [@claudiacodacy](https://github.com/claudiacodacy)! - Add `codacy issues --ignored` (`-i`) to list issues that were marked as ignored
  on Codacy. Without the flag, `codacy issues` behaves exactly as before; pass
  `--ignored` to see the ignored ones instead. The
  ignored listing accepts all the same filters as the normal search (`--branch`,
  `--severities`, `--categories`, `--tools`, `--patterns`, `--languages`, `--tags`,
  `--authors`, `--limit`, and `--false-positives`), and each ignored issue shows
  who ignored it, when, the reason, and any comment. It cannot be combined with
  `--overview` or `--ignore`. `--output json` emits an `ignoredIssues` array.
  Unignoring individual issues stays with `codacy issue <id> --unignore`.

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#26](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/26) [`bf903e4`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/bf903e45f6aaa96a25d4cdbfdf19966d2a5f1c38) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Add `ls` and `directories` commands to browse a repository's tree with quality
  metrics. `ls` lists the directories and files at a path — showing Grade, Issues,
  Complexity, Duplication, and Coverage per row — and `directories` (alias `dirs`)
  lists folders only, with `--plus-children` to also show one level of
  sub-directories as a `└─` tree. Both auto-detect the provider/organization/repository
  from the git remote and the path from your current directory (relative to the
  repo root); override with positional args, `--path`, and `--branch`. Sort with
  `--sort <field>` (`name`, `issues`, `grade`, `duplication`, `complexity`,
  `coverage`) and `--direction asc|desc`. `codacy ls --search <term>` finds files
  at any depth under the path. Folders and files are marked with `▸` and `·` (no
  emojis). Both commands fetch every page of results, so nothing is truncated.

- [#24](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/24) [`bf527ad`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/bf527ad694a3f7d78576a5a3647dd4d53984e088) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Add an npm-style "update available" notice. When a newer version is published, the
  CLI prints a one-time upgrade hint to stderr — it never auto-updates. The notice
  only shows with the default `--output table` in an interactive terminal; it is
  suppressed for `--output json`, when piped, in CI, and under `npx`/npm scripts, so
  machine-readable stdout stays byte-clean. The version lookup runs in a non-blocking
  background process (at most once a day) and never affects timing or exit codes. Opt
  out via `CODACY_DISABLE_UPDATE_CHECK`, `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`, or `--no-update-notifier`.
  A package.json `overrides` entry pins `update-notifier`'s transitive `got`/`package-json`
  to patched, still-CommonJS versions to avoid CVE-2022-33987.

### Patch Changes

- [#27](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/27) [`c5c9af5`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/c5c9af57f63bbdc2762acb59800de65247cdf94a) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Stop `issues --overview` from suggesting noise reduction on repositories that aren't
  actually noisy. The "Suggested actions to reduce noise" section now requires two absolute
  floors before anything is suggested: the repository must have at least 200 issues in total,
  and an individual pattern must produce at least 100 issues on its own. The per-pattern floor
  matters because a repository with a long tail of tiny patterns pulls the median issues-per-
  pattern very low, which previously made a pattern with only a handful of issues look
  disproportionate — now a rule has to genuinely flood the repo before it's flagged. On top of
  those floors, a pattern must still show a relative signal: the "dominant share" rule (≥10% of
  all issues) only applies when there are at least 11 distinct patterns (an even split of N
  patterns only drops below 10% once N is above 10, so 8-10 balanced patterns would otherwise
  all be flagged), and the "disproportionate count" rule now compares each
  pattern against the **median** issues-per-pattern instead of the mean, so a single huge
  pattern can no longer inflate the baseline and hide smaller-but-still-disproportionate ones.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#20](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/20) [`cbf62d5`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/cbf62d59da02d45b00a94cba2a1d275e615a7c5d) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - `codacy findings` and `codacy finding` now show the vulnerable dependency's import chain for SCA findings that carry the new `dependencyChains` field. Each finding is labelled **Direct** (`Update <pkg> to <fixedVersion>`) or **Transitive** (`<pkg> → … → <pkg> (Fixed in <fixedVersion>)`), and chains with 4+ packages collapse their middle to `<first> → ... N more ... → <last>`. The list shows the first chain plus `... and X more`; the detail lists every chain aligned under a single label. `dependencyChains` is also included in `--output json`.

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#18](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/18) [`7b09b5b`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/7b09b5ba254f7cd7f46a86bd594352e8d3751eb9) Thanks [@manufacturist](https://github.com/manufacturist)! - Fix `--version` flag reporting hardcoded `1.0.0` instead of the actual package version. The CLI now reads the version dynamically from `package.json` at runtime via `require`, so the reported version stays in sync with every release automatically.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#16](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/16) [`8f86866`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/8f86866ac41bf45dfe5d5be0593d180e95f99919) Thanks [@manufacturist](https://github.com/manufacturist)! - `codacy repo --output json` now includes a `fileCount` field on the repository object, plucked from `coverage.numberTotalFiles` on the existing `getRepositoryWithAnalysis` response. The field is present even on repos without coverage data, so no extra API call is needed. Lets consumers (e.g. the `configure-codacy-cloud` skill) read repo size without a separate roundtrip.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#14](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/14) [`ca896df`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/ca896dfb7da127454fc042e63169ce05e2e11130) Thanks [@pedrobpereira](https://github.com/pedrobpereira)! - Adds possibility of using the cli againsta other environments

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#11](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/11) [`12ad8a3`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/12ad8a30641a903e3d7a914dfd255bc2401287e5) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Auto-detect provider, organization, and repository from the git remote origin URL. All repository-scoped commands now work without explicitly passing `<provider> <organization> <repository>` — just run them inside a git repo with an `origin` remote pointing at GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

- [#13](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/13) [`f039b39`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/f039b39922440cb29d2d7e0ea7c7ea5091c3eb42) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Improve `issues --overview`. The False Positives table now uses human-friendly labels ("Not a False Positive" / "Potential False Positive") instead of the raw `belowThreshold` / `equalOrAboveThreshold` API bucket names. The overview also adds a "Suggested actions to reduce noise" section that flags noisy patterns — those accounting for at least 10% of all issues, or at least 3× the average issues-per-pattern — and prints a ready-to-run `codacy pattern <tool> <patternId> --disable` command for each (the owning tool is resolved automatically; suggestions whose tool can't be resolved are omitted). `--output json` output is unchanged.

- [#13](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/13) [`f039b39`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/f039b39922440cb29d2d7e0ea7c7ea5091c3eb42) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Make the pattern commands aware of local configuration files and coding standards.

  - `pattern <tool> <patternId>` with no action flag now **shows the pattern's information** (same card as the `patterns` command, with `--output json` support). Since there's no single-pattern endpoint, it searches by ID and keeps the exact match.
  - When a tool is driven by a local configuration file, `patterns` (list) and `pattern` (info) print `<tool> is using a local configuration file.` and skip fetching patterns; `patterns --enable-all/--disable-all` and `pattern --enable/--disable/--parameter` refuse with `Tool uses a local configuration file, can't be updated.`
  - `pattern --enable/--disable/--parameter` also refuses patterns enforced by a coding standard with `Pattern enforced by <standard> coding standard, can't be modified.`
  - `issues --overview` noise suggestions now adapt per pattern: a runnable `codacy pattern … --disable` command when possible, otherwise a manual step — `Update your local <tool> configuration file to disable the pattern` or `Update <coding standard> to disable the pattern`.

- [#13](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/13) [`f039b39`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/f039b39922440cb29d2d7e0ea7c7ea5091c3eb42) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Add a `--reanalyze-and-wait` (`-w`) variant to the `repository` and `pull-request` commands. Unlike `--reanalyze` (which triggers analysis and exits), this blocking variant captures a baseline of the current issues, triggers the reanalysis, polls until it finishes (every 10s, up to 20 minutes), and then prints how long the analysis took and what changed — issue deltas by pattern, severity, and category. Supports `--output json`.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#9](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/9) [`a973363`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/a973363794b803e13124ab592778e6eced2be88d) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - Fix tools import to preserve cloud-only tools (only disable tools the local CLI supports), handle config-file mode correctly (skip pattern reset when useLocalConfigurationFile is set), and surface structured API error details on import failures.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/pull/6) [`0280af1`](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/commit/0280af162217f5eec2094aca6d2f9e7efa9e615b) Thanks [@alerizzo](https://github.com/alerizzo)! - ### Changes since v1.0.5

  - **`--tools` filter for issues command** ([#4](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/issues/4)): Added `--tools` option to filter issues by the tool/pattern that detected them. Includes new formatting utilities for tool name display.

  - **Filter and bulk-ignore for false positives** ([#5](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/issues/5)): Added `--category` and `--severity` filters to the issues command. Introduced bulk-ignore functionality to ignore multiple issues matching filter criteria, streamlining false-positive triage workflows.

  - **Pin GitHub Actions to SHA hashes** ([#2](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/issues/2)): Pinned all GitHub Actions workflow dependencies to commit SHAs for improved supply-chain security.

  - **Adopt changesets for automated versioning and publishing** ([#6](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-cloud-cli/issues/6)): Replaced the manual publish workflow with a changesets-based release pipeline. PRs now require a changeset file, and merging to main triggers automated version bumps and npm publishing with provenance.
